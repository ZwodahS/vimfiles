This is my vimfiles. Let me emphasize this a once more. This is _MY_ vimfiles.

Everyone have their own vimfiles. It serve their workflow. Cloning this serve no purpose for you.
On top of that, i use Tmux with my Vim so my configuration takes into account that.

Having said that, feel free to take anything from here that you will find useful =)

3 Rules of Vim.

    1. Start small.
    2. Build your vimfiles slowly. Always have one thing that you are learning.
    3. Share and Learn from other vimfiles.

Happy Vim-ing
